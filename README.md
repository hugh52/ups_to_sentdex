The majority or pretty much all of this material was obtained by following along with the tutorials on https://pythonprogramming.net/ ; the youtube videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex ; and/or reviewing the actual sentdex website at http://sentdex.com/ .  The notes are either taken word for word from the tutorials or paraphrased, with some extras added in here and there by myself. 

This is essentially an attempt to recreate or somewhat follow various sentdex tutorials available at www.pythonprogramming.net, while ensuring the code runs updated for period end 2018 through beginning 2019.  The code was recreated using the open-source version of Anaconda3, now updated for use with Python 3.6.7 on Windows 10. As soon as I am able to get my Linux distro up and running alongside Windows, I will also include examples and updates for Linux.  However, as mentioned above, this will be a while because I have many projects to upload in Windows. 

I am unable to upload most data sets directly to Github because of the size, but if the individual datasets are not available here, I will do my best to include detailed instructions on how to obtain the datasets.

Additionally, since various libraries/packages/modules/what-have-you are needed at various times and later may not be needed, please excuse any areas where best-practices may not be properly followed.  This includes, for instance, where packages may be listed among the imports towards the top of the file, eventhough they may not be used within the code below (this is usually because they were used in previous files).  

Even with my advanced and "university-certified" knowledge (that was a joke, albeit a bad one, but a joke) of mathematics, statistics, and finance, I still did not have the means to apply my knowledge.  For years, I would start trying to learn C++, then R, then get distracted, then back to R, maybe another shot at C++, on and on until I had to find a job to actually make money instead of saying I was learning how I would make money.  I have read many books, followed along with other tutorials, but nothing has come close to what sentdex is able to offer.  The programming knowledge, along with the mix of statistical and practical ways of thinking, is extremely rare.  The energy and excitement coming from somone so passionate about what they do is so contagious, I have sometimes even found myself wishing he did not display the brevity that is one of those rare attributes seemingly so uncommon in this field and many others.  I have yet to find another programming course out there as pragmatic as the ones by sentdex; you will build actual applications that, given the concepts he explains, you can then expound upon yourself to create an application of your own.  Please, if you have not already, I strongly urge you to view the tutorials by sentdex.  

In a separate file, titled 'my_background_story...' I have tried to shed some light on my qualifications (or lack thereof...), as well as my background or story (as quick as possible, of course, there is waaay more) just in case it matters or anyone cares; if you wish to dicuss specifics, simply email me at 'whcherry52@gmail.com', and refernce this project, github, or whatever will get through my spam filter while also catching my attention, in the subject.


WARNING: 
- Since the work was origianlly completed using Python 3.6.6 (now use assumes Python 3.6.7), I will need to go back and test everything to ensure compatability with Python 3.7.3; once this has been completed, this warning message will be removed.  This may take some time, as I have run into multiple issues attempting to quickly update to the new version of Anaconda, which seems to just have been released two days prior to this writing.  That being said, I have full faith that the issues were caused by me and not the Anaconda crue (haha), so I will take a deeper look after I get this initial project up and going.

- I feel it is important to inform anyone that may come across this "project", that it is in NO way whatsoever an abriged version, nor a substitute for the original sentdex tutorials on which this is based.  It would be too much to even call this the cliff notes.  All I am providing is material I obtained while watching and studying tutorials by sentdex; very very little, if any, code had to be changed or updated, unlike my usual code replications from other sources.  Additionally, the notes are, for the most part, either paraphrased or taken directly from the tutorials.  Some comments might be my own, and if they seem incorrect or you do not agree with something, please contact me and I will admit fault or explain and attempt to teach the way I am viewing the matter.  


Please do keep in mind that this should only be used as a supplement to wonderful work done by sentdex and only if needed.  I hope this helps someone and please let me know what you think, what you hate, or what needs improvement, no matter how brutal the truth may be.   Yeah remember, do NOT take this as a quick fly-through sentdex course, Harrison is the real-deal and I beg you to listen to everything he says until you understand it. 

Thanks everyone!!!  Hope this helps at least one person!!!
