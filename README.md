PLEASE NOTE the following copyright notification to Harrison Kinsley/sentdex, which will also be available under the project licenses along with the MIT license: (c) Harrison Kinsley/sentdex

The majority or pretty much all of this material was obtained by following along with the tutorials on https://pythonprogramming.net/ ; the youtube videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex ; and/or reviewing the actual sentdex website at http://sentdex.com/ .  The notes are either taken word for word from the tutorials or paraphrased, with some extras added in here and there by myself.  

I do have a degree in Quantitative Finance with double minors in Mathematics and Economics for the University of Alabama, but when it comes to actually learning to program the information I learned during my undergrad, I would be lost without the tutorials from sentdex.  I highly recommend visiting his sites and viewing his lectures.  I will continue to update this github page, but please be patient as this is my first "project" and I have a very long way to go.  Any corrections/comments/complaints/etc. can be directed hear or sent to me personally.  

This is essentially an attempt to recreate or somewhat follow various sentdex tutorials available at www.pythonprogramming.net, while ensuring the code runs updated for period end 2018 through beginning 2019.  The code was recreated using the open-source version of Anaconda3, now updated for use with Python 3.7.1 on Windows 10. As soon as I am able to get my Linux distro up and running alongside Windows, I will also include examples and updates for Linux.  However, as mentioned above, this will be a while because I have many projects to upload in Windows. 

I am unable to upload most data sets directly to Github because of the size, but if the individual datasets are not available here, I will do my best to include detailed instructions on how to obtain the datasets.

WARNING: Since the work was origianlly completed using Python 3.6.6, I will need to go back and test everything to ensure compatability with Python 3.7.1; once this has been completed, this warning message will be removed.
