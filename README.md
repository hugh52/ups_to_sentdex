PLEASE NOTE: 
The following copyright notification is to/for Harrison Kinsley/sentdex, which will also be available under the project licenses along with the MIT license: (c) Harrison Kinsley/sentdex .  

The majority or pretty much all of this material was obtained by following along with the tutorials on https://pythonprogramming.net/ ; the youtube videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex ; and/or reviewing the actual sentdex website at http://sentdex.com/ .  The notes are either taken word for word from the tutorials or paraphrased, with some extras added in here and there by myself.  

I do have a degree in Quantitative Finance with double minors in Mathematics and Economics for the University of Alabama, but when it comes to actually learning to program the information I learned during my undergrad, I would be lost without the tutorials from sentdex.  I highly recommend visiting his sites and viewing his lectures.  I will continue to update this github page, but please be patient as this is my first "project" and I have a very long way to go.  Any corrections/comments/complaints/etc. can be directed hear or sent to me personally.  

This is essentially an attempt to recreate or somewhat follow various sentdex tutorials available at www.pythonprogramming.net, while ensuring the code runs updated for period end 2018 through beginning 2019.  The code was recreated using the open-source version of Anaconda3, now updated for use with Python 3.6.7 on Windows 10. As soon as I am able to get my Linux distro up and running alongside Windows, I will also include examples and updates for Linux.  However, as mentioned above, this will be a while because I have many projects to upload in Windows. 

I am unable to upload most data sets directly to Github because of the size, but if the individual datasets are not available here, I will do my best to include detailed instructions on how to obtain the datasets.

Additionally, since various libraries/packages/modules/what-have-you are needed at various times and later may not be needed, please excuse any areas where best-practices may not be properly followed.  This includes, for instance, where packages may be listed among the imports towards the top of the file, eventhough they may not be used within the code below (this is usually because they were used in previous files).  


WARNING: 
- Since the work was origianlly completed using Python 3.6.6 (now use assumes Python 3.6.7), I will need to go back and test everything to ensure compatability with Python 3.7.1; once this has been completed, this warning message will be removed.  This may take some time, as I have run into multiple issues attempting to quickly update to the new version of Anaconda, which seems to just have been released two days prior to this writing.  That being said, I have full faith that the issues were caused by me and not the Anaconda crue (haha), so I will take a deeper look after I get this initial project up and going.

I feel it is important to inform anyone that may come across this "project", that it is in NO way whatsoever an abriged version nor a substitute for the original sentdex tutorials on which this is based.  It would be too much to even call this the cliff notes.  All I am providing is material I obtained while watching and studying tutorials by sentdex; very very little, if any, code had to be changed or updated, unlike my usual code replications.  Additionally, the notes are, for the most part, either paraphrased or taken directly from the tutorials.  Almost a decade ago as of this writing, my short work in academia provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics, finance, and economics.  Since then, during my own time I have been practicing various methods to apply these skills, which of course all deal with programming or really only coding/scripting.  That being said, I am by NO means an expert (far from it) and as time goes by I realize more and more what a poor decision it was to "take a break" in the Florida Keys after finishing my undergrad, instead of starting the Applied Economics Masters program I had already been accepted to without even taking the GMAT or GRE (which of course, came with a Data Mining Certificate from the SAS Institute and only took one year to complete - although I must say, increadible fishing aside, I would not trade spending that time with my friends then for a spot learning from those running Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund today).  Anyway, my point here is not to talk about what could have been or tell kids not to have fun, I simply would like to stress that I am not the brains behind this operation, which will most likely shine through when the code and notes are ripped apart.  So now that you all are surely half asleep, if anyone actually managed to real all of that, then please feel free to contact me anytime with any questions, and I will do my best to answer as soon as possible.  However, please do keep in mind that this should only be used as a supplement to wonderful work done by sentdex and only if needed.  I hope this helps someone and please do not be afraid to reach out.  Thank you so much for
