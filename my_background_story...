Now, the rest of this I have no idea if it should even be written or included, and I am sure it should not be in the readme.  Although, once again, its my first project so I figured I would provide a few, or a lot, of random information that you may or may not find useful.  At the very least, maybe it will be entertaining...

Almost a decade ago as of this writing (started writing around April 5th, 2019), my short stent in academia provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics, statistics, finance, and economics.  Since then, on and off during my free time, I have been practicing various methods to apply these skills.  These methods for application of course all deal with programming or perhaps mostly just coding/scripting at my level.  However, out of college my experience was essentially non-existent, save one paper in graph theory where I pretty much just explained the code someone else had written.  Not exactly the skills needed to analyze financial markets and compete with people fresh out of Ivy League schools, programming since they were in first grade.  I knew the stats, the math behind it, probability theory, and even the academic-elegant econometric methods from a textbook standpoint.  I can tell you when certain tests are applicable and when they may not be, I could derive BSM Option Pricing Model, and then adjust it so it was more like what Nassim Taleb or Dr. Thorp would have used instead of the fantasy land model used by most people.  I had read and reproduced Benoit Mandelbrot's paper on the nature of speculative prices and the log-log plot showing what seemed to be stationary distributions of cotton prices (if my memory/terminology serves me right, haha).  However, when it came to actually applying the information I learned in undergrad (and yes, much was from personal reading,learning, and teaching, as academia still was not teaching what those in the field actually used...), I was lost.  Sure, I could throw a large number of technical indicators together, splitting the historical data into 10-20 different individual periods, then splitting each one individually into maybe 80% for training and 20% for testing, then using this to optimize the parameters of the indicators; but anyone with a Tradestation account could do this and obviously optimizing to fit historical data perfectly is rarely, if ever, a good idea.  I knew I needed to be able to produce my own ideas, through writing my own code or my own programs, but certain issues continued to come up, and I was far from a prodigy. 

My degree is in Quantitative Finance with double minors in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Alabama, with a major-GPA of 3.8. I had to attend grad school for my hard work during undergrad to be worthwile, basically to have a paper that said I know how to run numbers.  Of course, I had other plans and knew I could go to grad school anytime.  I do not make excuses, but a number of circumstances eventually lead to me losing my passion for financial markets, trading, data analysis, proving others wrong and myself right, and of course the competitive spirit which pushed me to find ways to win at most everything I attempted.  This had propelled me to fight through the numerous graduate level classes as an undergrad just a short time ago.  My opinion during and after college was that I should be taking all computer science, math, and statistics classes, since the finance side was so simple anyone could learn it.  For some reason, as this turned out to be more and more correct, I kept chalking my misfortune up to things out of my control.  This, I despised, for it was these types of people I could not stand, making excuses when my life was better than most and watching myself squander opportunity after opportunity, while I did nothing but wave goodbye to incredible potential.

People have often called me humble, but beleive me when I say/write this, I am by NO means an expert (far from it) and as time goes by I realize more and more what a poor decision it was to "take a break" and go about my other plans I mentioned above.  To start, I went against my "advisor's" orders that I should not take Graph Theory for my elective math class to complete my minor.  Advisor is in quotation marks there because for a finance student to get permission for a math minor at that time, well the Dean of the Finance School had to sign off on it; so my "advisor" was the Dean of the Finance School.  Of course, I told him thank you, and I will take History of Math, went home, logged onto my computer and signed up for Graph Theory - in my defense, he did try to tell me I could not pass it, so he kind of asked for it.  Needless to say, when I came back to him with my final grade of B+ or A- or whatever it was, he was first confused, then speechless, then very inviting.  He repeated himself multiple times, ensuring what he was reading was correct with other details concerning my grades and courses.  Sidenote: He was a complete genius and probably trying to solve some impossible problem in his head.  One look at his research papers once at home made me glad I did not see that first, I did not need that kind of intimidation.  End sidenote.  So he took me back to meet with the head of the Economics Department, we talked, then he offered me my dream.  

They both wanted me to start the Masters program in Applied Economics, where I had already been accepted that afternoon, without even taking the GMAT or GRE.  This came with the opportunity to run a sizeable portfolio throughout the year with a small team also in this or similar fields, maybe Statistics Masters, Finance PhD program, etc. built from large donations, in which we could also compete against other prominent schools. This program came with a Data Mining Certificate from the SAS Institute and only took one year to complete.  This meant, one year and I would be placed with a large company, running numbers and making a lot of money, especially for someone right out of school.  The ONLY bad part was grad school started in 2 days, which was kind of a blessing, no time for bad habits to creep back in.  So, of course, I stood up, shook both of their hands, and told them I was going to need a break but I would be back.  Now, 10 years later (almost 10 years), I still have not made it back.  

What was so important?  Fishing, partying, girls, beautiful weather and even prettier water year round.  Just a little drive south to the Florida Keys, first a little outside Key West and eventually moved on into Key West.  I was a bellman and vallet, worked at a tackle shop, every now and then I would open up my book on R or data mining and practice choosing the best indicators for a model using Random Forests and then adding in Support Vector Machines for reasons I do not even remember.  It was fun, but I was running from a couple personal matters that hit me like a ton of bricks coming home from school, while still trying to recover from the worst breakup of my entire life.  Strange it was not even really a breakup for other people.  For me, it was the end of the world, and it changed me.  Maybe I needed the trip to the Florida Keys; without it, I never would have made it to Chicago.  Although I have proceeded to do nothing but squander incredible opportunities up here too, time and time again.  Although I will say, increadible fishing aside, I would not trade spending that time with my friends back then for a spot on the desk of Renaissance Technologies' Medallion Fund today.  On second thought, maybe that is going a little far, oh wait hypothetical situation so ummmmm..... yeah you guy's are the best...  

My point here is not to talk about what could have been or tell kids not to have fun, one purpose is that I simply would like to stress once again that I am not the brains behind this operation.  I am only providing the code that worked for me and the notes I thought were important.  As already mentioned, very little code had to be changed or updated, and I felt most topics were covered in solid detail, especially with the extra references sentdex provides.  The additions or personal comments are not notated or distinguished in any way, so if you need to know simply contact me via email listed throughout this page and on bottom, and I will try to answer any question or separate the tutorial info from my personal additional info.  

If anyone is actually still reading, taking the last sentence a step further, feel free to contact me with questions about anything, and I will do my best to answer, or point you in the right direction.  I am origianlly from Mobile, AL and now live in Chicago, IL.  Questions could be related to math, stats, comp sci, philosophy, finance (preferrably leaning toward the pragmatic), really anything - I will tell you if it does not interest me.  Oh yeah, no politics please, I guess we can do religion but I am not having anything thrown at me nor would I throw anything at others.

And yes, I know I should shut up and keep these kind of stories/comments for blogs or some social media terribleness.  Instead of blowing up people's facebook pages with the incredibly lengthy and drawn out whatever the last few paragraphs would be called, I decided to leave my rant where I knew people would probably never read it.  And on the off chance they do, well then probability tells me those reading it are exactly the knowledge-curious, pragmatic, real-passion-for-their-interests (not just the money), audience I have always wanted to find. 


Thank you everyone!!!
